# battleShip


This is a basic battleship game (in it's current v1.0 form) for me to use as practice for devloping skills in python logic and looping structures.

To run:

1. Open the game with your console of choice as a python application.
2. Based on the 5x5 grid, select an X value, and then select a Y value for an intersecting coordiate where you think the enemy ship might be. (The enemy ship is currently 1x1 in size so aim carefully (: )

Current Bug List (v1.0)

1. Choosing a value of 5,5 on the 5x5 grid causes an array appending error due to the array starting at 0.


Feature List (Future Additions)
1. Allow variable size and quantity of ships.
2. Allow different sized maps based on difficulty level.
3. Allow two players.
    3a. Develop menu system for choosing options and game setup.
4. Allow game restart options.
