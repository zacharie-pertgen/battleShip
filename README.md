# battleShip


This is a basic battleship game (in it's current v1.0 form) for me to use as practice for devloping skills in python logic and looping structures.

To run:

1. Open the game with your console of choice as a python application.
2. Based on the 5x5 grid, select an X value, and then select a Y value for an intersecting coordiate where you think the enemy ship might be. (The enemy ship is currently 1x1 in size so aim carefully (: )
